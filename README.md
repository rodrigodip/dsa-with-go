# Data Structures and Algorithms with Golang

Welcome to my DSA learning repository! This is a curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms that I'm studying to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of computer science fundamentals.

## Goals

- **Learn** the theory and implementation of core data structures and algorithms.
- **Practice** with real coding problems.
- **Showcase** my skills and consistency to potential employers and recruiters.
